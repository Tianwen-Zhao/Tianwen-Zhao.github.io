[Identify Selective Forwarding Attacks Using Danger Model: Promote the Detection Accuracy in Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9755128)

**Xinyu Huang**, Yuanming Wu

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=cuDwCOwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cuDwCOwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cuDwCOwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'></span></strong>
- We proposed a multi-level detection scheme inspired by human immune system against selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. 
- The detection accuracy and the false alarm rate are much lower than other effective methods.
- We also reduced the computation complexity to $$O(n)$$.
